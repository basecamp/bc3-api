Get schedule entries
--------------------

* `GET /schedules/3/entries.json` will return a [paginated list][pagination] of active schedule entries in the schedule with ID of `3`.

To get the schedule ID for a project, see the [Get schedule][schedule] endpoint.

_Optional query parameters_:

* `status` - when set to `archived` or `trashed`, will return archived or trashed schedule entries that are in this schedule.

Get a schedule entry
--------------------

* `GET /schedule_entries/2.json` will return the schedule entry with an ID of `2`.

**Note:** this endpoint redirects to the first individual occurrence of the entry, for **recurring schedule entries**. It's also possible to access a recurring schedule entry via any of the individual occurrences: `GET /schedule_entries/2/occurrences/20190218.json` will return the occurrence for a recurring schedule entry with an ID of `2`, happening on `2019-02-18`. It'll return 404 for invalid occurrences.

Recurring schedule entries will include an additional `recurrence_schedule` attribute. For example:

```json
"recurrence_schedule": {
    "frequency": "every_month",
    "days": [
        1
    ],
    "hour": 10,
    "minute": 30,
    "week_instance": 3,
    "start_date": "2019-02-18",
    "end_date": "2019-10-25"
}
```

```


Create a schedule entry
-----------------------

* `POST /schedules/3/entries.json` creates a schedule entry under the schedule with an ID of `3`.

**Required parameters**:

* `summary` - what this schedule entry is about
* `starts_at` - date-time (ISO 8601) for when this schedule entry begins
* `ends_at` - date-time (ISO 8601) for when this schedule entry ends

_Optional parameters_:

* `description` - containing more information about the schedule entry. See our [Rich text guide][rich] for what HTML tags allowed.
* `participant_ids` - an array of people IDs that will participate in this entry. Please see the [Get people][people] endpoints to retrieve them.
* `all_day` - when set to `true`, the schedule entry will not have a specific start or end time, and instead will be held for the entire day or days denoted in `starts_at` and `ends_at`
* `notify` - when set to `true`, will notify the participants about the entry
* `recurrence_schedule` - makes the entry recurring. An object with:
  * `frequency` - one of `every_day`, `every_weekday`, `every_week`, `every_other_week`, `every_month`, `every_day_of_month`, `every_year`, `custom_week`, or `custom_month`
  * `days` - for `every_day`: which days of the week to recur on, as integers `0` (Sunday) through `6` (Saturday); omit to recur every day. For `custom_month` without a `week_instance`: which day of the month to recur on, `1` to `31`. Derived from `starts_at` for the other frequencies.
  * `week_instance` - for `every_month` and `custom_month`: which week of the month, `1` to `4`, or `-1` for the last week
  * `week_interval` - for `custom_week`: repeat every `2` to `12` weeks
  * `month_interval` - for `custom_month`: repeat every `2` to `12` months
* `recurs_until` - date (ISO 8601) the recurrence ends. Omit to recur indefinitely. Reflected as `recurrence_schedule.end_date` in the response.
* `visible_to_clients` - top-level boolean. When the project has clients enabled, whether the schedule entry is visible to them. Defaults to `false` (team callers creating directly under the docked tool); a **client** caller always creates client-visible records. See [Client visibility][client_visibility] to change it after creation.
* `status` - when omitted, a schedule entry created over the API is published (`active`) immediately. Passing `status: "drafted"` creates it as a draft instead. Note that, unlike messages and documents, schedule-entry drafts are **not** listed by [Get my drafts](drafts.md#get-my-drafts).

The remaining `recurrence_schedule` attributes shown in [Get a schedule entry](#get-a-schedule-entry) (`hour`, `minute`, `start_date`, `duration`, `end_date`) are derived from `starts_at`, `ends_at`, and `recurs_until` — they're ignored on input. An invalid `recurrence_schedule` is discarded on create: the entry is created without recurring.

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the schedule entry if the creation was a success. See the [Get a schedule entry](#get-a-schedule-entry) endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "summary": "Important Meeting",
  "starts_at": "2015-06-04T00:00:00Z",
  "ends_at": "2015-06-04T02:00:00Z"
}
```

###### Example JSON Request (recurring)

```json
{
  "summary": "Weekly sync",
  "starts_at": "2015-06-04T15:00:00Z",
  "ends_at": "2015-06-04T16:00:00Z",

  "recurs_until": "2015-12-18"
}

  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/schedules/3/entries.json
```


Update a schedule entry
-----------------------

* `PUT /schedule_entries/2.json` allows changing of the schedule entry with an ID of `2`.

Clients may change any of the required or optional parameters as listed in the [Create a schedule entry](#create-a-schedule-entry) endpoint. That includes adding a `recurrence_schedule` to make a non-recurring entry recur. An entry that already recurs can't be changed through this endpoint, though: it redirects to the entry's first occurrence, like [Get a schedule entry](#get-a-schedule-entry) does.

This endpoint will return `200 OK` with the current JSON representation of the schedule entry if the update was a success. See the [Get a schedule entry](#get-a-schedule-entry) endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "summary": "All Day Meeting",
  "starts_at": "2015-06-04",
  "ends_at": "2015-06-04",
  "all_day": true

Legacy project-scoped routes

The following project-scoped routes are still supported and will remain available, but flat routes above are the canonical form for new integrations.

* `GET /buckets/1/schedules/3/entries.json` → [Get schedule entries](#get-schedule-entries)
* `GET /buckets/1/schedule_entries/2.json` → [Get a schedule entry](#get-a-schedule-entry)
