Card table steps
================

These are the card-scoped endpoints for what are now called [subtasks][subtasks]. They will
remain available indefinitely, but their paths speak of cards. The
[subtasks][subtasks] endpoints work on a step under any recording — a to-do included — and are
the ones to use for new integrations. Both operate on the same records and return the same
payload.

Available since Basecamp 5: steps are now also reachable via flat top-level paths
(`/card_tables/steps/:id.json`, `/card_tables/cards/:card_id/steps.json`, …) in addition to the
historical bucket-scoped paths shown below. Both paths return the same JSON shape and accept the
same parameters; the flat paths are the canonical form and are preferred for new clients. The
legacy bucket-scoped `/buckets/:bucket_id/card_tables/...` paths continue to work for
backwards compatibility and are listed under "Legacy project-scoped routes" below.

Endpoints:

- [Get steps in a card](#get-steps-in-a-card)
- [Create a step](#create-a-step)
- [Update a step](#update-a-step)
- [Change step completion status](#change-step-completion-status)
- [Reposition a step](#reposition-a-step)

Get steps in a card
--------------------

The first 100 steps are returned as part of the [Get a card][card] endpoint payload. A card with
more than that reports the real total in `subtasks_count`; fetch the rest from `subtasks_url`.

Create a step
-------------------------

* `POST /card_tables/cards/2/steps.json` creates a step within the card with ID `2`.

**Required parameters**: `title` of the step.

_Optional parameters_:

* `due_on` - due date (ISO 8601) of the step.
* `assignee_ids` - an array of people ids that will be assigned to this step. Please see the [Get people][people] endpoints to retrieve them.
* `assignees` - a comma separated list of people ids (legacy format, prefer `assignee_ids`).

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the step if the creation was a success. See the step property of the [Get a card][card] endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "title": "Inspiration",
  "due_on": "2021-01-01",
  "assignee_ids": [30068628, 270913789]
}
```

###### Copy as cURL

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Inspiration", "due_on": "2021-01-01", "assignee_ids": [30068628, 270913789]}' \
  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/card_tables/cards/2/steps.json
```

Update a step
-----------------------

* `PUT /card_tables/steps/2.json` allows changing of the step with an ID of `2`.

_Optional parameters_:

* `title` - of the step.
* `due_on` - due date (ISO 8601) of the step.
* `assignee_ids` - an array of people ids that will be assigned to this step. Please see the [Get people][people] endpoints to retrieve them.
* `assignees` - a comma separated list of people ids (legacy format, prefer `assignee_ids`).

**Note:** this is a partial update — any parameter you omit is left unchanged. To clear a value, send it explicitly:

| To…                    | Send                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| leave a value unchanged | omit the parameter      |
| clear the due date     | `"due_on": null`         |
| remove all assignees   | `"assignee_ids": []`     |

This endpoint will return `200 OK` with the current JSON representation of the step if the update was a success. See the step property of the [Get a card][card] endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "title": "Updated inspiration",
  "due_on": "2021-01-01",
  "assignee_ids": [30068628, 270913789]
}
```

###### Copy as cURL

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Updated inspiration", "due_on": "2021-01-01", "assignee_ids": [30068628, 270913789]}' -X PUT \
  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/card_tables/steps/2.json
```

Change step completion status
-----------------------------

* `PUT /card_tables/steps/2/completions.json` will mark the step with an ID of `2` as completed or uncompleted depending on the completion parameter.

**Required parameters**:

* `completion` – Set to "on" to mark the step as completed and to "off" to mark the step as uncompleted.

This endpoint will return `200 OK` with the current JSON representation of the step if the update was a success. See the step property of the [Get a card][card] endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "completion": "on"
}
```

###### Copy as cURL

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"completion": "on"}' -X PUT \
  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/card_tables/steps/2/completions.json
```

Reposition a step
-----------------------------

* `POST /card_tables/cards/2/positions.json` allows changing the position of the step with an ID of `source_id` in the card with id `2`.

**Required parameters**:

* `source_id` – the step id. Step ids can be found via the [Get a card][card] endpoint.
* `position` – the 1-based position to move it to.

This endpoint will return `204 No Content` if successful.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "source_id": 3,
  "position": 4
}
```

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_id": 3, "position": 4}' -X POST \
  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/card_tables/cards/2/positions.json
```

Legacy project-scoped routes
-----------------------------

The following project-scoped routes are still supported and will remain available, but flat routes above are the canonical form for new integrations.

* `POST /buckets/1/card_tables/cards/2/steps.json` → [Create a step](#create-a-step)
* `PUT /buckets/1/card_tables/steps/2.json` → [Update a step](#update-a-step)
* `PUT /buckets/1/card_tables/steps/2/completions.json` → [Change step completion status](#change-step-completion-status)
* `POST /buckets/1/card_tables/cards/2/positions.json` → [Reposition a step](#reposition-a-step)
