Drafts
======

Endpoint for retrieving the current user's unpublished message, document, upload, and client approval/correspondence drafts across their active projects.

A draft is a [message](messages.md), [document](documents.md), file [upload](uploads.md), or client [approval](client_approvals.md)/[correspondence](client_correspondences.md) that has been saved but not yet published. Messages and documents can be drafted and published through the API — see the [messages](messages.md#create-a-message) and [documents](documents.md#create-a-document) sections. Uploads have their own [create](uploads.md#create-an-upload) and [update](uploads.md#update-an-upload) endpoints, but no documented way to create or publish a *draft* upload; client approvals and correspondences are read-only over the API. Drafts of all of these types still appear here, however they were authored.

Endpoints:

Get my drafts
-------------

* `GET /my/drafts.json` will return a [paginated list][pagination] of the current user's drafts, most recently updated first, regardless of how they were created. Drafts whose project has been archived or trashed are excluded.

Five kinds of drafts are returned:

* [Messages](messages.md)
* [Documents](documents.md)
* [Uploads](uploads.md)
* Client [approvals](client_approvals.md)
* Client [correspondences](client_correspondences.md)

**Not returned:** other resources can also be saved in a drafted state, but they aren't part of this list — notably [Google documents](google_documents.md) (which default to `drafted` when `status` is omitted), [cloud files](cloud_files.md), and [schedule entries](schedule_entries.md). This endpoint is not an exhaustive feed of everything you have unpublished.

Each draft carries an `excerpt`: up to 300 characters of plain-text content, or an empty string when the draft has no body yet. `parent` is `null` for drafts filed directly under their bucket, and `scheduled_posting_at` is `null` unless the draft is scheduled to publish later.
