To-do sets
==========

All to-do lists under a Basecamp are children of a to-do set resource.

Endpoints:

- [Get to-do set](#get-to-do-set)
- [Hide to-dos tool](#hide-to-dos-tool)


Get to-do set
-------------

* `GET /buckets/1/todosets/2.json` will return the to-do set for the Basecamp with an ID of `1`.

To get the to-do set ID for a Basecamp, see the [Get a Basecamp][1] endpoint's `dock` payload. This endpoint's payload includes the first 10 to-do lists in the `todolists` key. To retrieve more to-do lists, see the [Get to-do lists][2] endpoint.
