Get upload versions
-------------------

* `GET /uploads/2/versions.json` will return a list of version events for the upload with an ID of `2`, in reverse chronological order.

Three `action`s appear here: `created` and `active` mark the upload's publication, and `blob_changed` marks a file replacement. Filter on `action == "blob_changed"` to list only the replacements.

Each version event carries an `upload` object describing the file that version recorded:

* `filename`, `content_type` and `byte_size` — the file as it was at that version.
* `download_url` — downloads that specific version's file, unlike the upload's own `download_url`, which always serves the latest one.
* `app_download_url` — the equivalent link for the Basecamp web app.
* `current` — `true` for the most recent version, `false` for the rest. Exactly one version is current. Note that this is the newest *version*, which isn't necessarily the file you get from the upload's own `download_url`: [updating an upload](#update-an-upload) changes its metadata without recording a new version.

The whole `upload` object is omitted — not `null` — on the rare version whose file has since been removed from the account. The version event itself is still listed, so treat `upload` as optional when decoding.

Create an upload version
------------------------

* `POST /uploads/2/versions.json` replaces the file of the upload with an ID of `2`.

The upload keeps its ID, its URL and its comments, and the previous file stays available as a past version. Use this instead of [creating a new upload](#create-an-upload) when you're publishing a new release of the same file and want its link to keep working.

**Required parameters**: `attachable_sgid` for an uploaded attachment. See the [Create an attachment][attachments] endpoint for more info on uploading attachments.

_Optional parameters_:
* `base_name` - a new file name for the upload. `base_name` should be a file name *without* an extension (e.g. `"pizza"` for `"pizza.png"`). Omit it to keep the name of the file you uploaded.
* `description` - containing information about the upload. See our [Rich text guide][rich] for what HTML tags are allowed. Omit it to carry the previous version's description forward, or send `""` or `null` to clear it.
* `notify` - who to notify about the replacement: `default` (people subscribed to project notifications), `everyone`, or `custom` (specific people via `subscriptions`). Omit both `notify` and `subscriptions` to notify nobody.
* `subscriptions` - an array of people IDs to notify about the replacement and subscribe to the upload. Used when `notify` is `custom`, which is also how a `subscriptions` array sent without `notify` is read.

Notified people are subscribed to the upload. Client visibility isn't a parameter here: a replacement never changes who can see the upload, so clients are in the audience only when the upload is already visible to them.

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the upload if the replacement was a success. See the [Get an upload](#get-an-upload) endpoint for more info on the payload.

A replacement stores the new file alongside every past version, so it counts against the account's storage. If the account has reached its storage limit you'll see a `507 Insufficient Storage` and a response of:

```json
{
  "error": "The storage limit for this account has been reached."
}
```

###### Example JSON Request

  "attachable_sgid": "BAh2CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIsZ2lkOi7vYmMzL0F0dGFjaG1lbnQvNzM4NDcyNj9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--13982201abe18044c897e32979c7dccfe8add9c1",

  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/uploads/2/versions.json
```

Create an upload
----------------

* `POST /vaults/2/uploads.json` creates an upload under the vault with an ID of `2`.

**Required parameters**: `attachable_sgid` for an uploaded attachment. See the [Create an attachment][attachments] endpoint for more info on uploading attachments.

_Optional parameters_:
* `description` - containing information about the upload. See our [Rich text guide][rich] for what HTML tags are allowed.
* `base_name` - a new file name for the upload. `base_name` should be a file name *without* an extension (e.g. `"pizza"` for `"pizza.png"`).
* `visible_to_clients` - top-level boolean. When the project has clients enabled, whether the upload is visible to them. Defaults to `false` (team callers creating directly under the docked tool); a **client** caller always creates client-visible records. Applies only when creating directly in the tool's vault; items created inside a folder inherit the folder's visibility. See [Client visibility][client_visibility] to change it after creation.

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the upload if the creation was a success. See the [Get an upload](#get-an-upload) endpoint for more info on the payload. If the account has reached its storage limit you'll see a `507 Insufficient Storage` and a response of:

```json
{
  "error": "The storage limit for this account has been reached."
}

  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/vaults/2/uploads.json
```

Update an upload
----------------

* `PUT /uploads/2.json` allows changing the `description` and `base_name` of the upload with an ID of `2`.

This changes the upload's metadata only. To replace the file itself, see [Create an upload version](#create-an-upload-version).

_Optional parameters_:
* `base_name` - a new file name for the upload. `base_name` should be a file name *without* an extension (e.g. `"pizza"` for `"pizza.png"`). Omitting it — or sending `""` — keeps the current name.
* `description` - containing information about the upload. See our [Rich text guide][rich] for what HTML tags are allowed. Omit it to leave the description alone, or send `""` or `null` to clear it.

This endpoint will return `200 OK` with the current JSON representation of the upload if the update was a success. See the [Get an upload](#get-an-upload) endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "description": "<div>Meh</div>",
