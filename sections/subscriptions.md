Subscriptions
=============

Many of the resources in Basecamp 4 that can be commented on have _subscribers_, that is, people that will get notified when a new comment is added. To know if it's possible to modify the subscriptions for a recording, check its JSON response for the `subscription_url` attribute. This attribute contains the URL to hit to get information about current subscribers and to add/remove subscribers.

Endpoints:

- [Get subscription](#get-subscription)
- [Subscribe current user](#subscribe-current-user)
- [Unsubscribe current user](#unsubscribe-current-user)
- [Update subscription](#update-subscription)


Get subscription
----------------

* `GET /recordings/2/subscription.json` will return subscription information for a recording with an ID of `2`.
