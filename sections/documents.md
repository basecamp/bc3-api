Let Kurt know your changes so he can update that in the schedule.<br><br>\n        <strong>What are the expectations for the meetup as a member of Support?</strong>\n        The overall expectation is to work when you are scheduled - for a few focused hours per day. After those hours are done, you are free to mingle with the Basecamp crew! Everyone is on call Monday to help with cases as it's usually the busiest day of the week with talks, events and a backlog of cases.<br><br>\n        The most important expectation is to have fun, get to know more of your non support teammates if you are so inclined and have time to relax off cases.<br><br>\n        <strong>When you are working:</strong><br>\n        When thereâ€™s a talk going on by Liza/Matthew or something else, feel free to stop working until the talk is over and then swarm the cases when it is through.<br><br>\n        <strong>When you are not scheduled for cases (excluding Mondays):</strong><br>\n        On your time not scheduled for cases, feel free to mingle and get to know your company teammates!

This will typically only happen after talks done by Jason and David. Let's work together to get those cases clear!<br><br>\n        <strong>Phones</strong> - They will be OFF<br>\n        <strong>Twitter</strong> - Will be scheduled<br>\n        <strong>Meals</strong> - If you are scheduled to be on cases during a meal, feel free to take a break to eat and swarm the cases after you are done eating.

They will usually be scheduled into the support schedule already."
