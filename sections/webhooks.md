Webhooks
========

Basecamp can notify your application when something is changed through webhooks.
A webhook consists of a payload URL to be called, which must be HTTPS, and a list of types that'll trigger calls.

Basecamp will attempt to call the payload URL up to 10 times before deactivating the webhook. The duration between attempts
will grow exponentially longer to give your service time to recover. Basecamp will only consider a HTTP status code in
the 2xx range to be a successful response. We will not follow a 3xx redirect.

A webhook can be subscribed to updates from the types detailed below. The default is to subscribe to all of them:

- Comment
- Client::Approval::Response
- Client::Forward
- Client::Reply
- Document
- GoogleDocument
- Inbox::Forward
- Message
- Question
- Question::Answer
- Schedule::Entry
- Todo
- Todolist
- Upload
- Vault

(Note that chat isn't amongst the options. Check our [chat bot API][1] for that.)

Whenever an event is created for any of the types that webhook was created to match, Basecamp will call your payload URL.
All payloads follow the same JSON format:

As you'll note, the recording format is the basic generic format that all other content endpoints share, with the addition of a `content` field. This format won't include as many details about the recording as other specific endpoints return. For example, for a [todo][2], this won't include fields such as `description`, `completed` or `assignees`.

The payload for copy/move events will also include details on the copied recording under `"copy"`, following the basic recording format just described. For example:
```json

   "id":1479523571,
   "kind":"todo_copied",

```

After sending the payload, Basecamp will record the interaction with your application as a delivery record that can be introspected for debugging.
The delivery record includes the full request and response that occurred for that specific event relay.

##### Events triggering webhooks

Basecamp will send the following lifecycle events for all types, here using message as an example:

- message_created / message_active
- message_title_updated / message_content_updated
- message_copied / message_inserted
- message_archived / message_unarchived
- message_trashed / message_untrashed
- message_deleted

There are also a handful of shared operations around the types that pertain to all types, again using message as an example:

- message_subscribers_changed
- message_publicized

Comments added on any recording will trigger the following event:

- comment_created

Additionally, some types have unique events. They are as follows:

Todos:

- todo_completed
- todo_uncompleted

Questions:

- question_paused
- question_resumed


###### Inherited status

Note that some events triggered for a recording will also be triggered for its children. For example, when a message is archived or trashed, so are its comments. To differentiate between a recording that changed its status because of an action performed directly on it vs. an action performed on the parent, use `inherits_status` attribute. This indicates whether a recording's non-active status is inherited from its parent.

Create a webhook
----------------

* `POST /buckets/1/webhooks.json` creates a webhook in the project with ID `1`.

**Required parameters**: `payload_url` for the HTTPS url that Basecamp should call.
_Optional parameters_: `types` as an array of types, options given in the introduction.

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the vault if the creation was a success. See the [Get a webhook](#get-a-webhook) endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

``` json
{
  "payload_url": "https://example.com/endpoint",
  "types": [ "Todo", "Todolist" ]

Update a webhook
----------------

* `PUT /buckets/1/webhooks/3.json` allows changing the payload url and types of the webhook with an ID of `3` in the project with ID `1`.

**Required parameters**: `payload_url` for the HTTPS url that Basecamp will call.
_Optional parameters_: `types` as an array of types, options given in the introduction. `active` as a boolean whether this webhook should be matching.

This endpoint will return `200 OK` with the current JSON representation of the webhook if the update was a success. See the [Get a webhook](#get-a-webhook) endpoint for more info on the payload.
