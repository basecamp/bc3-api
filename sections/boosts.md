Boosts
======

To determine if a resource can be boosted, check for the presence of `boosts_count` and `boosts_url` attributes in its JSON response.

Boosts can be applied to recordings and to specific [events][events] on a recording. Boostable events are those with an action of `completed`, `adopted`, or `column_changed`. When an event is boostable, its JSON response will include `boosts_count` and `boosts_url` attributes.

Endpoints:

- [Get boosts](#get-boosts)
- [Get a boost](#get-a-boost)
- [Create a boost](#create-a-boost)
- [Destroy a boost](#destroy-a-boost)

Get boosts

* `GET /recordings/2/boosts.json` will return a [paginated list][pagination] of active boosts on the recording with ID of `2`.
* `GET /recordings/2/events/3/boosts.json` will return a [paginated list][pagination] of active boosts on the event with ID of `3` on the recording with ID of `2`.

Create a boost
--------------

* `POST /recordings/2/boosts.json` publishes a boost on the recording with an ID of `2`.
* `POST /recordings/2/events/3/boosts.json` publishes a boost on the event with ID `3` on the recording with ID of `2`. Only boostable events (`completed`, `adopted`, `column_changed`) accept boosts; other events will return `403 Forbidden`.

**Required parameters**: `content` as the body of the boost.

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the boost if the creation was a success. See the [Get a boost](#get-a-boost) endpoint for more info on the payload.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "content": "Great work!"
}
```

###### Copy as cURL

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Great work!"}' \
  https://3.basecampapi.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/recordings/2/boosts.json
```


Destroy a boost
---------------

* `DELETE /boosts/2.json` will destroy the boost with an ID of `2`.

Only the boost's creator or an admin can destroy a boost. Returns `204 No Content` on success, or `403 Forbidden` if the authenticated user does not have permission.
