Hill charts
===========

Hill charts visualize the progress of to-do lists on a hill-shaped curve, from "figuring things out" (uphill) to "making it happen" (downhill). Each tracked to-do list appears as a dot on the hill.

Hill charts belong to a [to-do set][2]. To get the to-do set ID for a project, see the [Get a project][1] endpoint's `dock` payload.

Endpoints:

- [Get hill chart](#get-hill-chart)
- [Update hill chart settings](#update-hill-chart-settings)


Get hill chart
--------------

* `GET /todosets/1/hill.json` will return the hill chart for the to-do set with an ID of `1`.

Update hill chart settings
--------------------------

* `PUT /todosets/1/hills/settings.json` allows tracking and untracking to-do lists on the hill chart for the to-do set with an ID of `1`.

Pass to-do list IDs to `tracked` and/or `untracked` arrays. Both are optional; you can track, untrack, or do both in a single request. Tracking the first to-do list enables the hill chart. Untracking the last to-do list disables it.

_Optional parameters_:

* `tracked` - an array of to-do list IDs to start tracking on the hill chart.
* `untracked` - an array of to-do list IDs to stop tracking on the hill chart.

Returns `200 OK` with the updated [hill chart](#get-hill-chart) JSON representation.

###### Example JSON Request

```json
{
  "tracked": [1069479573],
  "untracked": [1069479511]
}
