Chatbots
========

There are two types of chatbots in Basecamp: Those that are interactive and those that only post content on their own. 
Interactive chatbots can be queried or commanded by anyone in any room. You can even start a ping conversation with one.

Both types of chatbots are authenticated differently from how the rest of the API works. There's no OAuth exchange to perform.
Interactive chatbots have their queries and commands POST'ed directly to them with a piece of JSON. Whatever they return to
that POST is inserted into the room where the conversation is happening.

Alternatively, if a chatbot needs to post on their own, there's a special key'ed URL that's all that is needed. It's returned 
as `lines URL`. See the [Get a chatbot](#get-a-chatbot) endpoint for more info. If you have that URL, you can post content 
as that chatbot to that room. But what you can't do is read anything from the room. This is not a streaming service. It's 
intended purely for request/reply and blind reply interactions.

When an interactive chatbot is invoked, it'll receive a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "command": "What up?",
  "creator": {
    "id": 1007299143,
    "attachable_sgid": "BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIrZ2lkOi8vYmMzL1BlcnNvbQQcMDA3Mjk5MTQzP2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--919d2c8b11ff403eefcab9db42dd26846d0c3102",

    }
  },
  "callback_url": "https://3.basecamp.com/195539477/integrations/2uH9aHLEVhhaXKPaqrj8yw8P/buckets/2085958501/chats/9007199254741775/lines"
}
```

You can use the information in the creator block to enforce permission controls. If you have a deploy bot, then maybe only certain
people, with pre-specified IDs, will be able to interact with it.

If the interactive chatbot is able to provide a response right away, it can, as stated above, just return that as part 
of a text/html content-typed response with status code 200. This response has the same format as all other rich text in Basecamp, 
but also accepts these additional tags: `table tr td th thead tbody details summary`. The pair of details/summary is particularly 
useful for providing large chunks of information hidden behind a show/hide.

Here are a few examples of return content or content sent to the callback URL from what we use at Basecamp:

Alert warning from Nagios with inline resolution links:

```html
<details><summary><a href="https://example.com">🔴 CRITICAL some.ip.37signals.com Http Profile /Common/bc3_anycast_production_https_profile</a></summary><pre>CRIT - High Error Levels - 20 4xx, 0 5xx</pre>
<p><strong>Unacknowledged</strong></p>
<p>
  <a href="https://example.com/ack">Acknowledge</a> |
  <a href="https://example.com/disnotif">Disable Notifications</a> |
  <a href="https://example.com/down">Schedule 2hr Downtime</a>
</p>
<p>Status changed less than a minute ago and was previously Warning.</p>
</details>
```

Status update from AWS:

It's important to note that chatbots are account-wide, but with basecamp-specific callback URLs. So you create a chatbot on a specific
Basecamp to get the callback URL for that Basecamp, but the chatbot will instantly be available to every other Basecamp on the account as well.
This also means that any edits or deletes of chatbots are account-wide. For this reason, chatbots can only be managed by administrators.
But everyone is able to interact with interactive chatbots and all you need to post as a chatbot is that callback URL.
